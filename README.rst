Please head over to our `online documentation <https://django-photologue.readthedocs.org/>`_ 
for instructions on installing and configuring this application.

Python 3? Amazon S3?
--------------------
Yes! Photologue is CI tested against both Python 2 and Python 3.

For S3, you'll have to install Boto, which for now is not compatible with Python 3 so you're stuck with Python 2.7...
