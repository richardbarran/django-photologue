   Sphinx-generated official documentation for Photologue :-)

Photologue
==========

Improved image management for the Django web framework.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Photologue is with pip::

   pip install django-photologue

You can verify Photologue is available to your project by running the following
commands from within your project directory::

    manage.py shell
    >>> import photologue
    >>> photologue.VERSION
    (2, 0, 'rc1')

Tracking the Development Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current development version of Photologue can be checked out via Git from the project site using the following command::

    git clone git://github.com/jdriscoll/django-photologue.git

Dependencies
------------

Photologue uses the Django admin app, `so enable it if you have not already done so <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/admin/>`_.

Configure Your Django Settings
------------------------------

#. Add 'photologue' to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
         # ...other installed applications,
         'photologue',
    )

#. Confirm that your `MEDIA_ROOT <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#media-root>`_ and
   `MEDIA_URL <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#std:setting-MEDIA_URL>`_ settings 
   are correct (Photologue will store uploaded files in a folder called 'photologue' under your ``MEDIA_ROOT``).

Add the urls
------------

Add photologue to your projects urls.py file::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        ...
        (r'^photologue/', include('photologue.urls')),
    )
    
Sync Your Database
------------------

Run the Django 'syncdb' command to create the appropriate tables. After the database in initialized, run the following command to initialize Photologue::

    python manage.py plinit


Instant Photo Gallery
---------------------

Photologue comes with basic templates for galleries and photos. You can of course override them, or completely
replace them. Note that all Photologue templates inherit from ``photologue/root.html``, which itself just inherits from
a site-wide ``base.html`` - you can change this to use a different base template.

Additional Documentation and Support
------------------------------------

`Offical docs are available on Google Code <http://code.google.com/p/django-photologue/w/list>`_ (Photologue is 
in the process of tranferring from Google Code to Github).
