   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to django-photologue's documentation!
=============================================

The Photologue documentation is being transferred from a Google Code wiki to a
Sphinx-generated setup (if you're reading this at readthedocs.org, then you're
looking at these docs).

This documentation is accurate and up-to-date (hopefully!);
`the old docs on the Google Code wiki <http://code.google.com/p/django-photologue/w/list>`_
are extensive but have not been updated in a long time.
