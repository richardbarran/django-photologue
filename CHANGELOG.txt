Upgrade notes:

WARNING: IF YOU'RE USING POSTGRESQL AS A DATABASE & DJANGO 1.7, THE LATEST RELEASE OF
DJANGO-SORTEDM2M HAS A BUG. INSTEAD, YOU'LL HAVE TO MANUALLY INSTALL:

pip install -e git://github.com/richardbarran/django-sortedm2m.git@9a609a1c6b790a40a016e4ceadedbb6dd6b92010#egg=sortedm2m



THE FOLLOWING CHANGES BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY!

- Django 1.7 comes with a new migrations framework which replaces South - 
  if you continue to use Django 1.6, you'll need to add new settings. Please
  refer in the docs to the installation instructions.
  If you're upgrading to Django 1.7 - upgrade Photologue first, THEN upgrade
  Django.
- The Twitter-Bootstrap templates - previously in 'contrib' - become the default; the
  previous templates are moved to 'contrib'.
- The django-tagging library is no longer maintained by its author. As a consequence,
  it has been disabled - see the docs for more information (page
  https://django-photologue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pages/customising/settings.html#photologue-enable-tags)
- Support for Django 1.4 and 1.5 has been dropped (Photologue depends on django-sortedm2m,
  which has dropped support for 1.4; and Django 1.5 is no longer supported).
- PHOTOLOGUE_USE_CKEDITOR has been removed.
- Many urls have been renamed; photologue urls now go into their own namespace. See the urls.py
  file for all the changes.

Other changes:

- Support for Amazon S3 to store images (thank you Celia Oakley!).
- List views have changed urls: instead of /page/<n>/, we now have a /?page=<n> pattern.
  This is a more common style, and allows us to simplify template code e.g. paginators!
- date_taken field not correctly handled during single photo upload (#80).
- Removed deprecated PhotologueSitemap.
- Gallery zip uploads would fail if the title contained unicode characters.
- Gallery-uploads: Do not require title for uploading to existing gallery (#98).
- The Photologue urls used to use names for months; this has been changed to using
  numbers, which is better for non-English websites (#101).


2.8.3 (2014-08-28)
------------------

- Updated Spanish translation.


2.8.2 (2014-07-26)
------------------

- The latest release of django-sortedm2m is not compatible with older 
  versions of Django, so don't use it (issue #92).


2.8.1 (2014-07-26)
------------------

- Fixed issue #94 (problem with i18n plural forms).
- Updated Slovak translation.

2.8 (2014-05-04)
----------------

Upgrade notes:

1. Photologue now depends on django-sortedm2m and django-model-utils - please
   refer to installation instructions. These dependencies should be added 
   automatically.

2. Run South migrations.

List of changes:

- Photo and Gallery models now support Django's sites framework.
- Photologue now uses django-sortedm2m to sort photos in a gallery.
- Major rewrite of zip archive uploader: warn users of files that could not be
  processed, get code to work with Python 3 (issue #71), add extra error
  handling.
- Renamed field title_slug to slug - this allows us to simplify views.py a
  bit.
- PHOTOLOGUE_USE_CKEDITOR, PHOTOLOGUE_GALLERY_PAGINATE_BY and
  PHOTOLOGUE_PHOTO_PAGINATE_BY are deprecated.
- Fixed pagination controls for photo list template.
- Tightened naming rules for Photosize names.
- Fixed a couple of unicode-related bugs.
- Added to the documentation pages describing how to customise the admin and
  the views.
- Refactored slightly views.py.
- Started work on chainable querysets.

2.7 (2013-10-27)
----------------

Upgrade notes:

1. All settings are now prefixed with ``PHOTOLOGUE_``. Please check that you are
   not affected by this.

List of changes:

- Fixed issue #56, Gallery pagination is broken.
- Photologue now works with Python 3.
- Added a set of templates that work well with Twitter-Bootstrap 3, and used
  them for the 'example_project'.

  are empty.

2.6 (2013-05-19)

Upgrade notes:

1. Photologue now relies on Pillow instead of PIL. The easiest way to upgrade
   is to remove PIL completely, then install the new version of Photologue.
2. Photologue, in line with Django itself, has dropped support for Django 1.3.

List of changes:

- Switched from PIL to Pillow - hopefully this should make installation
  easier.

  migration.
- Added feature to allow extending the built-in templates (and documented
  it!).
- Allow editing of Photo added date (temp way of sorting photos).

  project.
- Fixed buggy Travis CI script.
- fixed issue #52, transactions in migration
- fixed issue #51, uniqueness collisions in migration

  gallery list view.
- Photologue requires min. Django 1.4.
- Tidied a data validator on PhotoSizes.

2.4 (2012-08-13)
----------------

Upgrade notes:

1. Starting with this version, Photologue uses South to manage the database
   schema. If you are upgrading an existing Photologue installation, please
   follow the South instructions at:
   http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/convertinganapp.html#converting-other-installations-and-servers

2. Photologue has dropped support for Django 1.2.

List of changes:

- updated installation instructions.
- fixed issue #9 (In Django 1.3, FileField no longer deletes files).
- switched from function-based generic views to class-based views.
- fixed PendingDeprecationWarnings seen when running Django 1.3 - this will
  make the move to Django 1.5 easier.
- added unit tests.
- fixed bug where GALLERY_SAMPLE_SIZE setting was not being used.
- fixed issue #11 (GalleryUpload with len(title) > 50 causes a crash).
- fixed issue #10 (Increase the size of the name field for photosize).
