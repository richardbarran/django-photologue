- Release Photologue as a universal wheel.


3.3.1 (2015-07-20)
------------------

3.3 (2015-07-20)
----------------

- In the initial data setup, the 'thumbnail' photosizes should not increment the
  view count (issue #133).
- Fix typo in admin text (issue reported by Transifex user ciastko).
- Updated translations: Hungarian, Czech, Dutch.
- Zip upload used gallery title instead of "Title" field for photos (#139).
- Zip upload: an uploaded photo is not a duplicate of an existing photo simply because they share the same slug.

3.2 (2015-05-11)
----------------

- Rotation of photos based upon EXIF data if available, so they get displayed correctly (#122).
- Misc doc tweaks.
- Only clear scale cache if image has changed.

  soon as the app is run, but having settings to tweak this value is not needed as it's so
  easy to override in a Django project.
- PHOTOLOGUE_GALLERY_PAGINATE_BY and PHOTOLOGUE_PHOTO_PAGINATE_BY were previously deprecated
  and have now been removed.
- Tagging has been removed from Photologue.

Upgrade notes:

WARNING: IF YOU'RE USING POSTGRESQL AS A DATABASE & DJANGO 1.7, THE LATEST RELEASE OF
DJANGO-SORTEDM2M HAS A BUG. INSTEAD, YOU'LL HAVE TO MANUALLY INSTALL:

pip install -e git://github.com/richardbarran/django-sortedm2m.git@9a609a1c6b790a40a016e4ceadedbb6dd6b92010#egg=sortedm2m



THE FOLLOWING CHANGES BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY!

- Django 1.7 comes with a new migrations framework which replaces South -
  if you continue to use Django 1.6, you'll need to add new settings. Please
  refer in the docs to the installation instructions.
  If you're upgrading to Django 1.7 - upgrade Photologue first, THEN upgrade
  Django.
- The Twitter-Bootstrap templates - previously in 'contrib' - become the default; the
  previous templates are moved to 'contrib'.
- The django-tagging library is no longer maintained by its author. As a consequence,
  it has been disabled - see the docs for more information (page
  https://django-photologue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pages/customising/settings.html#photologue-enable-tags)
- Support for Django 1.4 and 1.5 has been dropped (Photologue depends on django-sortedm2m,
  which has dropped support for 1.4; and Django 1.5 is no longer supported).
- PHOTOLOGUE_USE_CKEDITOR has been removed.
- Many urls have been renamed; photologue urls now go into their own namespace. See the urls.py
  file for all the changes.

Other changes:

- Support for Amazon S3 to store images (thank you Celia Oakley!).
- List views have changed urls: instead of /page/<n>/, we now have a /?page=<n> pattern.
  This is a more common style, and allows us to simplify template code e.g. paginators!
- date_taken field not correctly handled during single photo upload (#80).
- Removed deprecated PhotologueSitemap.
- Gallery zip uploads would fail if the title contained unicode characters.
- Gallery-uploads: Do not require title for uploading to existing gallery (#98).
- The Photologue urls used to use names for months; this has been changed to using
  numbers, which is better for non-English websites (#101).


2.8.3 (2014-08-28)
------------------

- Updated Spanish translation.

2.8.2 (2014-07-26)
------------------

- The latest release of django-sortedm2m is not compatible with older
  versions of Django, so don't use it (issue #92).

2.8.1 (2014-07-26)
------------------

- Fixed issue #94 (problem with i18n plural forms).
- Updated Slovak translation.

2.8 (2014-05-04)
----------------

Upgrade notes:

1. Photologue now depends on django-sortedm2m and django-model-utils - please
   refer to installation instructions. These dependencies should be added
   automatically.

2. Run South migrations.

List of changes:

- Photo and Gallery models now support Django's sites framework.
- Photologue now uses django-sortedm2m to sort photos in a gallery.
- Major rewrite of zip archive uploader: warn users of files that could not be
  processed, get code to work with Python 3 (issue #71), add extra error
  handling.
- Renamed field title_slug to slug - this allows us to simplify views.py a
  bit.
- PHOTOLOGUE_USE_CKEDITOR, PHOTOLOGUE_GALLERY_PAGINATE_BY and
  PHOTOLOGUE_PHOTO_PAGINATE_BY are deprecated.
- Fixed pagination controls for photo list template.

  the views.
- Refactored slightly views.py.

   not affected by this.

List of changes:

  them for the 'example_project'.

  are empty.

------------------

List of changes:

- Fixed broken packaging in release 2.6.

2.6 (2013-05-19)
----------------

Upgrade notes:

1. Photologue now relies on Pillow instead of PIL. The easiest way to upgrade
   is to remove PIL completely, then install the new version of Photologue.
2. Photologue, in line with Django itself, has dropped support for Django 1.3.

List of changes:

- Switched from PIL to Pillow - hopefully this should make installation
  easier.

  migration.

  it!).

  project.

- added Django 1.4 timezone support.

2.4 (2012-08-13)
----------------

Upgrade notes:

1. Starting with this version, Photologue uses South to manage the database
   schema. If you are upgrading an existing Photologue installation, please
   follow the South instructions at:
   http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/convertinganapp.html#converting-other-installations-and-servers

2. Photologue has dropped support for Django 1.2.

List of changes:

- use South to manage schema changes.
- updated installation instructions.
- fixed issue #9 (In Django 1.3, FileField no longer deletes files).
- switched from function-based generic views to class-based views.
- fixed PendingDeprecationWarnings seen when running Django 1.3 - this will
  make the move to Django 1.5 easier.
- added unit tests.
- fixed bug where GALLERY_SAMPLE_SIZE setting was not being used.
- fixed issue #11 (GalleryUpload with len(title) > 50 causes a crash).
- fixed issue #10 (Increase the size of the name field for photosize).
